                    <p class="story-text">Some stories don’t announce themselves. They begin softly—inside office corridors, between formal conversations, and in moments that seem ordinary at the time. They worked in the same organization, though their paths hadn’t crossed for a long while. She was part of the HR team, and he was a software developer. For nearly a year, he had been working from home. By the time he finally came to the office for the first time, she had already joined a few months earlier. Their first meeting was simple and unplanned. He had come to submit some documents, and she was the one handling the process. They spoke briefly about work. During that short conversation, she mentioned that she had recently moved to Mumbai from Bhopal for the job. When everything was done, she walked with him till the lift. It was brief, polite, and easy—nothing more, nothing less.</p>

                    <p class="story-text">The second time he truly noticed her was at the office Secret Santa party. She was wearing a red top with black trousers. The moment he saw her, something felt different. She hosted the event with grace, keeping the energy alive, and the evening turned into one full of laughter and fun for everyone. A few months later, the work-from-home phase ended, and everyone returned to the office. He began coming in regularly. The first proper conversation they had after this was about a company policy. Out of habit and respect, he addressed her as “Aap.” She smiled and gently corrected him, asking him not to be so formal and to call her by her name—Komal. That moment marked the beginning of something more natural and comfortable between them.</p>

                    <p class="story-text">Soon after, casual conversations turned into regular chit-chat. She spoke openly about herself; she was friendly, expressive, and easy to talk to. Within days, a shared friendship with Hemant brought them closer. From then on, the three of them became a small group—sharing gossip, laughter, and everyday moments—without realizing that this was just the beginning.</p>

                    <p class="story-text">Some bonds grow quietly—so quietly that even the people living inside them don’t realize when friendship begins to turn into something more. Almost a year had passed, and they were still just friends. Somewhere along the way, regular conversations turned into daily calls. The calls grew longer without either of them noticing time slip by. An hour became routine. An hour and a half felt normal. Once, the conversation stretched to four and a half hours—she talking endlessly, he listening patiently. Somewhere between those conversations, both of them sensed that there was something special, yet neither dared to name it. The friendship mattered too much to risk. By then, he had moved on from the company and switched jobs. She was close to doing the same. They had spent time together outside work—shopping for Secret Santa, sharing a ride back from Poptates—but one meeting stood apart: Westside. It was there that she told him about a job offer in Bangalore. She was unsure whether to move or stay back in Mumbai and look for opportunities. That moment mattered because, by then, he had developed feelings for her. He had planned to ask her out, but the words never came. Sitting across from her, he felt as though a part of him was slipping away, and he could do nothing to stop it. He understood that her career mattered, and so he let the moment pass.</p>

                    <p class="story-text">A few days later, during Ganesh Chaturthi, they decided to visit the Ganpatis of Lalbaug together. That night became unforgettable. They began their darshan around 11 p.m. and were still walking through the lanes at 4 a.m. When the night finally ended, he dropped her home. Soon after, she told him she had accepted the Bangalore offer and would be moving in December. Then came the night that changed everything. It was November, during Navratri. They decided to go for Garba in Kandivali with a few friends, both of them fond of dancing. He met her at the metro station. She was dressed in a traditional Garba outfit and looked stunning. He wore a kurta. They danced, laughed, and enjoyed the evening. It had rained earlier, and they played Garba in the open field. Her hair was still wet, and something about that moment stayed with him. On the way back, the group got scattered, and for a brief while, it was just the two of them together in the train. He didn’t stop himself this time. He asked if they could meet that Saturday. She said yes.</p>

                    <p class="story-text">On 19th October 2024, they met. Knowing she would soon leave for Bangalore, he finally said what he had been holding back. He told her that it felt like a part of him was leaving and that he didn’t want to regret staying silent. He asked her if she would like to be his girlfriend. She was stunned. Then she said yes. She told him she had feelings too but had never spoken about them, afraid it might change their friendship. That was how they began dating—after nearly two years of being friends. And even then, it was clear this was only the beginning.</p>

                    <p class="story-text">With her decision to move to Bangalore, time in Mumbai suddenly felt limited. November was all they had, and even that slipped away quickly. It was Diwali season, which meant she had to travel to Bhopal to be with her mother—the only time she truly got to spend with her. When she returned, they made the most of every moment. Evenings after office and weekends were spent together, knowing this time wouldn’t come again anytime soon. They had already decided that if this was meant to work, they had to be present for each other as much as possible. Then came 9th December 2024—the day she left for Bangalore. He went to the airport to drop her, carrying a sunflower, her favorite flower, something she had once mentioned casually. It was emotional for both of them, but the step had to be taken. And just like that, she left.</p>

                    <p class="story-text">As she began settling into life in Bangalore, they found comfort in nightly video calls after office. It became a routine that helped bridge the distance. With Christmas approaching, he planned a surprise. He booked a flight for the night of the 24th, determined to spend their first festival together as a couple. When she opened the door and saw him standing there, she was shocked. They hugged, and in that moment, everything felt complete. Christmas was spent at Bob’s, a place she had discovered through her friends—friends he met a few days later and who quickly felt special to him: Meghu, Manju, and Teresa. Among the many memories Bangalore gave them, New Year’s Eve stood out. Meghu and Manju hosted a house party with close friends, and the night was filled with games, laughter, and celebration. It was the first time he saw Komal in party wear. She looked stunning, completely in her element, and the night passed in pure joy. He had taken work-from-home for a few days, and together they explored the city—cafés and restaurants scattered across Bangalore. Nagarjuna, Satya, The Beer Library, DYU Café, Yuki, and their favorite, Hole in the Wall, which they visited every time he came to the city. It was also the first time they stayed together, just the two of them. He took on household chores to help her, learning along the way, and they found comfort in those small, everyday moments.</p>

                    <p class="story-text">Time moved faster than either of them realized. His return date crept closer. On the night he had to leave, he had an early morning flight and needed to leave around 3 a.m. She came downstairs to see him off and waited as the cab arrived. When it finally pulled away, they both knew they would have to stay apart again—for longer this time. Later, she told him it was the first time she cried after he left, falling asleep that way. He was just as quiet, replaying every moment from Bangalore. And somewhere between the memories and the distance, he realized something clearly for the first time—he was falling in love with her.</p>

                    <p class="story-text">Then came his birthday—a moment they had been waiting for. They planned to meet, and she flew all the way to Mumbai for it. For two days, they shared time between Andheri and Bandra, making each moment count. On the first day, they went to Jimi’s, a place she wanted him to try. Later that evening, they had thought of attending her friend’s engagement, but plans changed. Instead, she surprised him with a birthday celebration. She gifted him hand-painted drawings—thoughtful and deeply personal, something he instantly loved. Along with that came a T-shirt, a blender for his protein shakes, and a monkey-shaped cup, a playful reminder of how she fondly called him her monkey. The day filled itself with quiet, memorable moments, and celebrating Valentine’s Day with her made it feel even more special.</p>

                    <p class="story-text">The next morning, they headed to Bandra. They had booked a small Airbnb known as The White Room. The moment they stepped in, everything felt calm. The place was silent, minimal, and elegant—simple yet classy in a way that made both of them fall in love with it. He remembers feeling unusually relaxed, as though time had slowed down just for them. That evening, they went to Andora Café and enjoyed their meal before wandering around and eventually returning, drawn back by the comfort of the space. The night ended with pizza, Chantilly Nutella cheesecake, and hot chocolate—a perfect, unhurried ending.</p>

                    <p class="story-text">After her last visit to Mumbai, neither of them knew when they would meet again. That changed two months later, just before her birthday, when he traveled to Bangalore for a week. By then, Komal had settled in properly. She had her utensils, and most days were spent eating home-cooked food. She cooked, and he helped her in whatever way he could. Alongside those quiet routines, they went out exploring, discovering places that felt uniquely Bangalore. The week passed without them realizing it, and soon it was time for him to return to Mumbai. Not long after, she was scheduled to visit Mumbai as well, as her mother was coming there too. Around this time, something began to feel missing for her. It wasn’t just work or family—it was the growing weight of distance. Keeping the long-distance going the way they had so far was becoming difficult.</p>

                    <p class="story-text">She missed her family deeply and started feeling distant from everything around her. During this phase, her roommate, Ayushi, became her support system—helping her break down bigger problems and offering guidance on what could be done. Slowly, she began searching for jobs specifically in Mumbai. During her visit, she even attended an interview. It didn’t meet her expectations, but it helped her understand her direction and reaffirm her desire to return.</p>

He remembered how peacefully she slept there, calmer than he had ever seen her before. Soon after, she had to leave for Bangalore again. This time, though, she wasn’t traveling alone. Her mother was with her, and the two of them were going to spend a week together.</p>

                    <p class="story-text">After Komal’s last visit, there was no fixed plan for when or how they would meet again. She had begun applying for jobs more aggressively, hoping to find her way back. Two to two-and-a-half months later, he decided to surprise her and booked his tickets to Bangalore without telling her. A week after he made the booking, she finally received a job offer in Mumbai—one that matched her expectations. The timing felt unreal. Her joining date was just two days after the return flight he had already booked. Whether coincidence or something more, it left them both incredibly happy. She was shocked when she found out about his travel plans, especially knowing she would need him during the packing and shifting.</p>

                    <p class="story-text">He flew to Bangalore determined to bring her back home. As usual, he took a night flight. But this time, something in the air didn’t agree with him. By the time he reached her place, he had a cold and fever. The next three days were spent mostly in bed, without the energy to move. Through it all, she took care of everything. She cooked, cleaned, and looked after him without complaint. In those moments, he didn’t just feel in love—he felt certain he was with the right person, even as guilt crept in for not being able to help with the packing. By the last few days, he started feeling better. They couldn’t explore Bangalore the way they had planned, but he finally met her roommate, Ayushi, and her boyfriend, Anant. The four of them went on a double date to Indian Bier House, sharing good food and an easy, joyful evening. The final day arrived quietly. Their flight was scheduled for 8 a.m., and since the airport was two hours away, they had to leave by 4 a.m. Packing was still incomplete. Knowing it was her last time in Bangalore, she wanted one final outing. They packed through the morning, stepped out in the afternoon for one last trip around the city, and returned to finish what they had started.</p>

                    <p class="story-text">They began packing seriously at 8 p.m. Hours passed, and by 4 a.m., they were still sorting through bags and boxes. For a moment, Komal thought they would miss the flight. Somehow, everything came together. A cab was booked, and they reached the airport just in time to board. It didn’t feel real. For the first time, they were flying together—not apart. With that flight, they ended their long-distance journey and said a final goodbye to Bangalore.</p>

                    <p class="story-text">After returning from Bangalore, they spent as much time together as they could. Soon, it would be a year since they had started dating. Wanting to make it special, he considered many ideas, but one stood out—a short trip to Goa. When he first shared the thought with Komal, she wasn’t very keen. But as days passed, her excitement slowly grew, especially when she began shopping specifically for the trip.</p>

                    <p class="story-text">The day they left for Goa finally arrived. They had planned a three-day getaway to North Goa and booked a beautiful Airbnb near Candolim. The moment they reached the location, they knew they had chosen the right place. It was just the two of them, spending time exactly the way they wanted. That night, they went to Britto’s. The food was exceptional, and she loved the place so much that they returned again on their last day. The secondtime, she even sang there—it was karaoke night. They spent their days trying different Goan dishes, exploring restaurants, and enjoying long scooter rides, which became one of the highlights of the trip.</p>

                    <p class="story-text">The time in Goa felt short but deeply memorable. As they were leaving, both of them wished they could stay longer. The trip had been calm, relaxing, and filled with moments they would carry with them. Every story has its end, and so did the Goa trip—but it left behind the quiet promise of many more journeys to come.</p>
